 <p style="text-align: center; background-color: #ff29a0;">Nicki Minaj is the greatest, most eloquent, lyrically talented artist of our time.</p>

<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 50px; background-color: #000000; color: #ff29a0;">Onika Tanya Maraj-Petty, known professionally as Nicki Minaj, is a Trinidadian-born rapper, singer, and songwriter based in the United States. Her first major album was "Pink Friday", however she had many mixtapes before. Pink Friday includes several of her hit songs, such as "Moment 4 Life", "Your Love", and "Super Bass". Since then, she has had many successful releases with the albums, "The Pinkprint", and "Queen". Arguably, her most memorable song is "Super Bass", which I have linked below if you would like to listen!

<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 50px; background-color: #ff29a0; color: #000000;">Nicki Minaj does not shy away from philanthropy and motivational speaking either. She often donates money back home to Trinidad and she works with a nonprofit to support girls getting an education in India. Below is a link to one of her speeches telling the "Barbs" to stay in school.</p>
